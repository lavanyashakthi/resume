        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>
            Accomplished professional with expertise in diverse Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools. I am an experienced CFD researcher with a focus on solving complex problems related to multi-phase flow using numerical methods such as OpenFOAM, Star CCM+, COMSOL, and Ansys Fluent. My research interests include non-Newtonian fluids and their behavior in multi-phase flow. I have a strong background in programming languages such as Python, C++, FORTRAN, and MATLAB and have developed proficiency in pre-processing and post-processing tools such as Gambit, Gmsh, and ParaView. Additionally, my experience as a Post-Doctoral Researcher, Research Assistant, and Teaching Associate, combined with my effective communication, ability to work collaboratively, project management skills, make me a valuable addition to any team.
